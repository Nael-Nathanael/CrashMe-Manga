# CrashMe Manga - Backend

Manga Aggregator and Tracker Backend

This repository contains the backend code for my manga aggregator and tracker website. The website allows users to
discover new manga titles, track their reading progress, and receive notifications when new chapters are released. The
backend code is built using Python, and includes functionality for crawling, scraping, reading, and tracking Manga.

## TL;DR

I'm creating Tachiyomi-like website lol
